    <h1>EECS 440 Portfolio by Nick Cameron</h1>
    <p>Hey there! My name is Nick and I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Michigan. Welcome to my portfolio showcasing the exciting Extended Reality projects completed throughout the Fall 2024 semester for EECS 440.</p>
    <h2>Project 1: CSE Simulator</h2>
    <p>The first project was created in collaboration with two other students using Unreal Engine 5 and tested using the Meta Quest Pro. This project aims to simulate the (not so?) average evening for a CS student grinding out projects in a lab, with inspiration from the historic BBB 1695. We utilized Blueprints, Classes, Actors, Event Graphs, Functions, Imported Models, and Affordances within the Unreal Engine to create this immersive and unique experience. Collaboration took place via group chat, in-person meetings at the <a href="https://xr.engin.umich.edu/visualization-studio/">Visualization Studio</a>, version control using GitHub, and task management through Google Sheets and Jira. See the video below for an overview of the completed project with an unexpected discovery of luxuries!</p>

    <h2>Project 2: A2 Go!</h2>
    <p>The second project was created in collaboration with one other student using the Unity Engine and tested both in Unity and on iOS. This project takes inspiration from Pokemon Go but instead involves discovering seeds, planting trees, and fending off pesky squirrels. We utilized MapBox, UI Elements, Prefabs, Scenes, Components, GameObjects, C# Scripting, and Animation Controls to create a standalone application capable of running on mobile devices. Collaboration took place over text, in-person meetings, version control using GitHub, and task managment through Google Sheets and Jira. See the video below for an overview of the application with a unique Quests feature that unlocks a special seed!</p>
