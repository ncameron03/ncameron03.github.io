    <h1>EECS 440 Portfolio by Nick Cameron</h1>
    <p>Hey there! My name is Nick and I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Michigan. Welcome to my portfolio showcasing the exciting Extended Reality projects completed throughout the Fall 2024 semester for EECS 440.</p>
    <h2>Project 1: CSE Simulator</h2>
    <p>The first project was created in collaboration with two other students using Unreal Engine 5 and tested using the Meta Quest Pro. This project aims to simulate the (not so?) average evening for a CS student grinding out projects in a lab, with inspiration from the historic BBB 1695. We utilized Blueprints, Event Graphs, Functions, Imported Models, and Affordances within the Unreal Engine to create this immersive and unique experience. Collaboration took place via group chat, in-person meetings at the <a href="https://xr.engin.umich.edu/visualization-studio/">Visualization Studio</a>, version control using GitHub, and task management through Google Sheets and Jira. See the video below for an overview of the completed project with an unexpected discovery of luxuries!</p>
